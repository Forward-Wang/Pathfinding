		-----------------------------------------------------


This repository contains implementations for A* algorithm used for pathfinding in languages Java and C.


------------------------------------------- C --------------------------------------------------------

In the folder src, the file robots.txt contains the implementation for A* in C.
In folder input_files, there are sample input files that can be used to test the program.
The input files contain a map with certain "obstacles" and the initial places of 2 "robots".
After executing the program, the following procedure takes place :
- the 1st robot makes a random move in the gap.
- the 2nd robot makes 3 moves following A* in order to meet the 1st robot.
- the algorithm stops when the 2 robots are met.

Execution :
./robots	input.txt
./robots 	input2.txt
./robots	input3.txt




------------------------------------------- Java -----------------------------------------------------

In the folder src, the file Golfo contains the main class used to resolve the problem of pathfinding.
In folder input_files, there are sample input files that can be used to test the program.
The input files contain a map with certain "obstacles" and the initial places of 2 "robots".
After executing the program, the output is the number of moves the first robot has to do at least
to reach the second robot in its initial place.
The folder bin, contains the compiled classes.

Execution :
java Golfo small_1.txt
java Golfo small_2.txt
java Golfo medium_1.txt
java Golfo medium_2.txt
java Golfo medium_3.txt
java Golfo medium_4.txt
