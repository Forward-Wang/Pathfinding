A* algorithm for pathfinding

robots.c is an implementation of A* algorithm for pathfinding.
"input.txt" is the input file containing a map with obstacles
and the initial places of 2 "robots".
After executing the program, the following procedure takes part:
- the 1st robot makes randomly a move in the map
- the 2nd robot makes 3 moves following the best possible path in order
to meet the 1st robot

"input2.txt", "input3.txt" are input files with bigger map.
